 * The VLCLibrary is the base library of the VLCKit.framework.  This object provides a shared instance that exposes the

 * VLCKit.framework is loaded into memory.  Also, it is automatically destroyed when the VLCKit.framework is unloaded
 * from memory.
 *
 * Currently, the framework does not support multiple instances of VLCLibrary.  Furthermore, you cannot destroy any
 * instiantiation of VLCLibrary, as previously noted, this is done automatically by the dynamic link loader.
